This repository is a complete toolkit to run [Zero-Gravity](https://0g.ai/) Nodes using docker with minimal effort. includes :
- Node/Validator
- Storage Node
- Storage KV
- DA Client
- DA Encoder
- DA Node

and more to come



### How to use
You can find documentation about this repository on our website at [EmberStake - ZeroGravity](https://docs.emberstake.xyz/networks/zero-gravity/nodes-guide/getting-started)

### Known Issues & Limitation

it seems zks_node logs can't be piped to stderr/stdout , so we utilized some custom scripts and supervisor to workaround it.
if the zks_node process dies the container will continue to live as normal, because the logger script is yet alive. it will be resolved as soon as https://github.com/0glabs/0g-storage-node/issues/91 gets resolved.
